# The Worb Manifesto

It is our belief that the ubiquitous connectivity offered to us today has fallen massively short of its potential.
Something isn't right if we feel trapped, rather than empowered, by the capacities we possess.
There has to be a real, fundamental reorientation towards and reappraisal of how we build.
What we need is to see technology as a gift, not a burden.
That gift cannot be given if it cannot be trusted or appreciated.
What we need is a renewed belief in one another.
That faith cannot flourish if we continue to perceive people as users and reduce their lives to blocks of time we can capture.
We want to build away from cynicism and towards something better, sharing our progress through the ubiquitous connectivity we've already developed.
